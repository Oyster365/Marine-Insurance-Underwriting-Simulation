## About
- This project is created as a portfolio piece to showcase underwriting and data analysis approaches. 
- The mock data takes place all in one year, thusly a regression analysis to predict trends over time is less applicable. 
- Linear cross-sectional regression analysis on the data set yielded low R-squared values, indicating it would be less useful for accurate analysis. 
- A What-If Sensitivity Analysis was selected as the approach mode for analysis.
